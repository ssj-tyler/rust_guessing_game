# rust_guessing_game

The code from a tutorial guessing game project found within "The Book" for the programming language Rust.  

This tutorial teaches you how to use packages from dependent libraries, how to use a basic loop, how to input and output from the terminal, and how to match expressions. Rust seems like a very fun language, and much more user-friendly compared to C++ which was the first language I ever learned.
